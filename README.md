# L8Z 

L8Z is a product which helps teams of varying sizes communicate securely with each other to maximise work productivity. L8Z accommodates for all team-orientated projects by allowing groups to be created alongside channels for direct management of members within the group. Isolating channels from the main team allows Project Managers/Team Leaders to efficiently and effectively address sub-group critical information and track sub-group progress.

The most important features that L8Z possess are:

1.  User Registration, Profile, Dashboard and Agenda
    
2.  Creation of Organisations, Channels and Instances
    
3.  TCP/IP Encrypted Organisational and Private Messaging with Chat History Persistence and Exportation
